Set up mongo docker without creds:

docker run --name <some name for your container> -d -p 27017:27017 mongo:latest

explanation: -d runs the container in detached mode, meaning we are returned to our regular terminal prompt after typing the command, rather than going straight into the container's terminal

-p maps the port of the container to the port on our machine

to get to the container's terminal, we type docker exec -it <name of container> bash

On subsequent starts, we don't use run, but start:

docker start <name of container>

The connection string to use in applications using the MongoDB is then simply mongodb://localhost:27017
